MOT	'cause we haven't tried that yet <you mean> ? 
CHI	<we haven't tried> it . 
CHI	hello oh run away . 
MOT	there has to be a pattern we have to figure it out . 
CHI	okay so this guy is the same but with weak arms . 
CHI	should we steal ? 
MOT	'cause he's weak ? 
CHI	yeah he can't run after us oh we could ask him . 
MOT	okay <let's ask him> . 
CHI	<he looks friendly> . 
MOT	you should've just <waved> . 
CHI	<just> waved ? 
MOT	<why did we> +// ? 
CHI	<there's no gem> .

MOT	we stole from the +/ . 
CHI	we stole from the green guy . 
CHI	gonna steal oh <he's> friendly . 
MOT	<nope> . 
CHI	we just stole from this guy . 
MOT	I think we might lose quickly . 
CHI	yeah we . 
CHI	can we get negative points ? 
INV	no . 
CHI	no . 
MOT	oh_well this is gonna be over soon . 
CHI	yeah alright so this guy's the same . 
MOT	wave . 
CHI	wave ? 
MOT	I think ? 
MOT	I'm failing this pattern . 
CHI	friendly alien . 
MOT	why are we making mistakes ? 
CHI	I don't know . 
CHI	hi . 
MOT	I'm usually good at this kind of <arms are down> and blue . 
CHI	<this guy is> +... 
CHI	and blue chonky legs . 
MOT	and big eyes . 
CHI	big eyes . 
CHI	their faces seem the <same> . 
MOT	<does that have anything> to do with it or are we missing something completely obvious ? 
CHI	yeah is there just a gem poking out of his pocket ? 
CHI	ask for a gem ? 
CHI	I don't know but those last ones to ask for it . 
CHI	I'm gonna do ask for it . 
CHI	nope just waved . 
CHI	we got the first ones right . 
MOT	'cause we were being evil ? 
MOT	I don't know honey . 
MOT	but it will be humiliating when we figure <out> what it is . 
CHI	<hm> . 
CHI	whoa okay this guy has some devil eyes on him . 
CHI	he's the same with weird eyes . 
CHI	so I'm gonna steal from this guy . 
MOT	why ? 
CHI	I don't know . 
CHI	his eyes are just really creeping me out nope just wave so he's friendly . 
MOT	mhm . 
MOT	we are not catching on to <the pattern> . 
CHI	<mm_mm> . 
CHI	okay so green's +... 
MOT	I've lost count . 
MOT	alright let's just keep losing . 
CHI	yeah . 
CHI	we'll get lucky one time . 
MOT	so it has nothing to do with the arms being up or down . 
CHI	maybe it's just a [/] maybe it's just a twenty five percent chance every time . 
MOT	okay . 
CHI	so I think the arms do mean +// . 
CHI	I'm sure like it matters . 
MOT	I don't think it matters . 
MOT	<the spots matter> . 
CHI	<okay this guy's spotted> . 
CHI	and he has weak little arms . 
CHI	and he has small legs . 
CHI	did this guy look like he has money on him ? 
CHI	he looks like a frog . 
MOT	did we steal from the guy with the spots ? 
MOT	and the <small legs> ? 
CHI	<the guy with the spots> was buff though . 
MOT	okay then what was the result of that one ? 
CHI	we got gems . 
MOT	did we ask or take ? 
CHI	I think the legs also matter 'cause <I've seen> some guy with big legs and small legs . 
MOT	<yeah> . 
MOT	okay . 
CHI	I think we stole from him that last guy . 
MOT	the big dude ? 
CHI	the big dude the first guy that <we faced> . 
MOT	<so do we> try stealing ? 
CHI	from this guy ? 
CHI	I don't +... 
MOT	is it the spots or the legs ? 
CHI	is this guy a bad guy ? 
MOT	we won't know until we decide . 
MOT	you can +... 
CHI	ask him ? 
MOT	I think it's steal . 
CHI	no it's just waved . 
MOT	why do we keep waving ? 
CHI	'cause he's poor he doesn't have gems how do we find out which one's poor and which one's +..? 
CHI	okay that guy is spots blue buff legs weird eyes . 
CHI	weak arms . 
MOT	mhm . 
MOT	blue we asked . 
CHI	spots blue . 
CHI	eyes arms and legs that's five . 
MOT	I think he's friendly . 
CHI	think he's friendly ? 
MOT	I think he's friendly . 
CHI	wave or ask ? 
CHI	ask ? 
MOT	I'm not sure . 
CHI	ask oh he's bad . 
MOT	okay . 
CHI	so he mugged us . 
MOT	we only have one more chance . 
CHI	okay this guy's the same just with . 
CHI	normal eyes . 
MOT	<so if he's bad right> if he's good it's the eyes . 
CHI	<he seems like a good chap> . 
CHI	just keep asking ? 
MOT	that's the best way to narrow down all the variables . 
MOT	so the eyes make him <friendly> ? 
CHI	<we have> <zero points> . 
MOT	<and we [/] and> we're done . 
CHI	well no but the guy with the weird eyes before this one was a good guy . 
MOT	oh yeah . 
MOT	we failed . 
CHI	it's alright we still have more [//] we have more chances this is the same one oh wait buff legs though . 
MOT	okay . 
CHI	alright so this could help us determine <what buff> legs mean . 
MOT	<right> [/] right . 
MOT	if we continue asking +... 
CHI	maybe buff legs mean big pocket <means steal> . 
MOT	<oh okay> . 
CHI	no okay buff legs friendly no money <wave> . 
MOT	<okay> . 
MOT	arms down . 
CHI	arms down . 
MOT	thin . 
CHI	hm . 
CHI	just a big old butt okay this is [//] guy's the same no spots and green . 
CHI	no spots and green . 
MOT	friendly . 
MOT	right ? 
MOT	unless green means mean . 
CHI	ugh okay green so_far has not been successful so um do we wave ? 
MOT	nice we got two . 
CHI	nice okay so he has no money he's a friendly . 
CHI	'cause he's skinny . 
MOT	okay . 
CHI	and . 
MOT	<arms down> . 
CHI	<green means poor> . 
CHI	oh . 
MOT	he's completely the opposite . 
CHI	mhm . 
MOT	so we steal . 
MOT	right ? 
CHI	but he's green does green mean poor ? 
MOT	well here we will figure that out . 
CHI	here we'll figure that out okay so steal ? 
MOT	steal or run . 
CHI	steal okay so green doesn't mean poor which doesn't help us <but we have more points now> . 
MOT	<exactly> which is the ultimate goal . 
CHI	yeah . 
CHI	well this guy's the same as the other guy before him right ? 
MOT	different eyes . 
CHI	no same eyes the two [/] the two before . 
CHI	except I wasn't looking at the legs were the legs thin or fat ? 
MOT	I think he looked like this with the red eyes . 
CHI	no [/] no the one [//] not the one we just did but two before . 
MOT	<two before> ? 
CHI	did he have big legs or skinny legs ? 
MOT	I don't remember it's too many to remember . 
CHI	so he looks alright so let's ask him no . 
MOT	no we should've <just waved> . 
CHI	<should've waved> . 
MOT	why ? 
CHI	I don't know . 
MOT	I need to write all this down this is too many things for my brain . 
CHI	okay this guy is buff fat legs blue and some spots . 
MOT	didn't we <just see him> ? 
CHI	no . 
MOT	with different eyes . 
MOT	and we stole from him . 
MOT	so if we steal from this guy . 
CHI	should we <run> ? 
MOT	<then it's> the eyes . 
CHI	steal from this guy and then the eyes that what ? 
MOT	that changed it . 
CHI	changed it to what ? 
MOT	'cause the last guy that looked like that with spots blue buff arms +// . 
MOT	did he have arms up or down ? 
MOT	arms up . 
CHI	arms up . 
MOT	big legs had the red eyes though <but we stole> from him and finally got some points right ? 
CHI	<red eyes> .
