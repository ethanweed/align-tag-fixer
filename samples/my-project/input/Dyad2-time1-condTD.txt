CHI	did the other one have a gem ? 
MOT	hm they have gems but they're not necessarily obvious . 
CHI	ah see how his eyes are red ?

CHI	okay . 
CHI	so small eyes must mean angry so this is big upward posture . 
MOT	no [/] <no spots> . 
CHI	<no spots> so we wave ?

MOT	why are they friendly ? 
MOT	go we're halfway through man we're blowing this . 
CHI	lose this . 
MOT	spots so it has gems ? 
CHI	it has a gem I think downward posture is angry I think upward posture is bad .

MOT	red eyes <it's got upward posture> . 
CHI	<<it's got a gem> [/] it's got a gem> 'cause it's upward posture so I say we ask for a gem <I say we> [/] I say we steal . 
MOT	go_ahead . 
MOT	I'm not convinced .

CHI	yep . 
CHI	upward posture <we steal> [/] <we steal> [/] we steal . 
MOT	they're friendly eyes . 
CHI	but eyes in the past okay downward posture . 
MOT	so the only difference between the last two and the last one and this one is eyes . 
CHI	no 'cause other one was upward posture . 
MOT	the last one wasn't . 
CHI	yeah it was it [/] it was flexing . 
MOT	go . 
CHI	so what do you wanna do ? 
CHI	steal ? 
CHI	or do we run ? 
CHI	I say we run . 
CHI	steal 'cause the only difference is downward upward and if it's steal and downward means nothing upward <means> gem . 
MOT	<go> . 
CHI	<okay> . 
MOT	<okay> . 
CHI	so downward no gem red eyes . 
MOT	this one you [/] you wave at .
