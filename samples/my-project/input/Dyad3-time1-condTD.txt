MOT	alright . 
CHI	okay . 
MOT	oh so what do you wanna do ? 
CHI	I think +... 
MOT	is it timed ? 
INV	it's not timed so that bell just means that you can then press the spacebar to then click your <response> . 
CHI	<okay> . 
MOT	<oh> okay . 
CHI	I think he doesn't look good his eyes are scary and he looks like strong and intimidating . 
MOT	these were the three that were in the front they all look the same to me but different colors . 
CHI	<okay> . 
MOT	you could choose this <one why don't we choose and then we'll decide after> ? 
CHI	<I [/] I think for the first> one we should run away just to be safe 'cause if we steal then like . 
MOT	okay since the . 
CHI	yeah . 
MOT	so we're gonna run away . 
CHI	we +// . 
CHI	oh it was friendly so he was green . 
MOT	okay <and> . 
CHI	<so> maybe that and he was strong so maybe that's okay ? 
MOT	alright . 
CHI	he's blue and he has warts <so> . 
MOT	don't judge him by his <warts> . 
CHI	<well> I'm just . 
MOT	okay <so> what do you wanna do for him ? 
CHI	I think he is . 
MOT	<so there's> [//] I think there were three aliens and there's four choices . 
CHI	well I'm sure that there might be more . 
MOT	okay <there wasn't a okay [/] okay> . 
CHI	<that was just three> um . 
MOT	I don't think we have enough information this is just <totally random> so make a <random decision> . 
CHI	<yeah> <so> I think we should wave to <him> and then I think he might be nice . 
MOT	<okay> . 
CHI	so he was . 
CHI	so blue with warts and he was nice and [//] but he didn't have gems . 
MOT	correct . 
CHI	okay . 
MOT	that could change though . 
CHI	blue he has to be evil . 
MOT	okay . 
CHI	and he doesn't have a gem <I think> [/] I think blue means you don't have a gem . 
MOT	oh okay and then you can decide <whether you're gonna run so> . 
CHI	<yeah but so> he doesn't have a gem and he's bad because the green guy . 
MOT	yup . 
CHI	who had a gem so then that means we already have the two good people . 
MOT	okay . 
CHI	so then for the bad people . 
MOT	okay that's reasonable . 
CHI	so that means we should run away . 
MOT	correct . 
CHI	I think . 
CHI	<he was> [//] he's friendly but he didn't have a gem . 
MOT	alright . 
CHI	<so he> [//] so maybe blue ? 
MOT	I don't know we can just pick +// . 
MOT	yeah okay . 
CHI	anyone that's blue so_far +// .

CHI	no blue guy with [//] same guy that looked like this who had long eyes was um . 
CHI	he was friendly and [//] but he didn't have a gem . 
MOT	correct . 
CHI	so <maybe> . 
MOT	<maybe> he's friendly and has a gem . 
CHI	okay let's ask . 
CHI	so he was +... 
MOT	friendly <and had a gem> . 
CHI	<he was> blue . 
MOT	<big eyes> . 
CHI	<he had> big eyes and big arms . 
MOT	okay . 
CHI	so maybe the big arms and big eyes means you have the gem . 
MOT	mhm . 
CHI	but except_for it didn't apply for green . 
MOT	maybe it's blue versus green . 
CHI	blue guy with weak arms and big <eyes> . 
MOT	<oh> I didn't notice that . 
CHI	yeah so I think . 
MOT	I think <he's friendly but doesn't have anything> . 
CHI	<he's friendly but doesn't have a gem> . 
MOT	right ? 
MOT	oh maybe . 
CHI	okay .
